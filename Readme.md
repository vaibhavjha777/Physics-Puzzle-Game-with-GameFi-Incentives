## **Project Title**
**Physics Puzzle Game with GameFi Incentives**

## **Project Description**
The **Physics Puzzle Game with GameFi Incentives** is an innovative blockchain-based game where players solve physics puzzles and earn cryptocurrency rewards. This play-to-earn model motivates players by rewarding them with cryptocurrency (Ether or a custom ERC-20 token) every time they successfully complete a level. 

Players progress through a series of levels, each of which presents unique physics-based challenges. As they complete each level, they earn rewards which can be claimed in Ether (or another token), allowing them to withdraw their earnings to their Ethereum wallet. This decentralized approach to gaming ensures transparency and fairness, making every interaction traceable and verifiable.

The game operates on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing smart contracts to automate the process of rewarding players based on their achievements in the game. Each level completion updates the player’s progress, and rewards are directly sent to the player’s wallet after claiming.

## **Project Vision**
The vision of this project is to integrate educational physics puzzles with blockchain technology, providing a fun and rewarding experience for players. The play-to-earn model aims to engage players by offering real-world value for their time and problem-solving skills. By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, the game ensures fairness, security, and transparency for every user interaction.

Through this project, we aim to revolutionize the gaming industry by combining educational content with rewarding gameplay, fostering a sustainable ecosystem where users can enjoy entertainment while learning and earning rewards.

## **Key Features**

- **Play-to-Earn Model**: Players earn cryptocurrency (Ether or ERC-20 tokens) by completing levels. Every time a player finishes a level, they are rewarded with cryptocurrency.
  
- **Level Progression**: The game consists of multiple levels, with each level offering more challenging physics puzzles. Players must complete each level to advance to the next one.

- **Reward System**: For every level completed, players accumulate rewards. These rewards can be claimed once they accumulate enough, making the game a source of passive income as players progress.

- **Decentralized & Transparent**: The smart contract ensures transparency, as all actions (level completion and rewards) are stored on the blockchain. Players can verify their progress and rewards at any time.

- **Customizable Parameters**: The contract owner can adjust the reward amount for each level and the total number of levels in the game, allowing for flexible game design and balance.

- **Owner Privileges**: The contract owner has the ability to set and modify game settings such as the reward amount and the total number of levels. This allows for future updates and changes to the game mechanics.

- **Simple & Secure**: The contract is designed to be simple, efficient, and secure, ensuring that players can interact with the game without complications.

- **Ethereum Blockchain Integration**: All game-related transactions (rewards and level progression) are executed on the Ethereum blockchain, making the game immutable and resistant to tampering.
